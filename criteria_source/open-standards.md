## Requirements

* For features of the [codebase](../glossary.md#codebase) that facilitate the exchange of data the codebase MUST use an [open standard](../glossary.md#open-standard) that meets the [Open Source Initiative Open Standard Requirements](https://opensource.org/osr).
* Any non-open standards used MUST be recorded clearly as such in the documentation.
* Any standard chosen for use within the codebase MUST be listed in the documentation with a link to where it is available.
* Any non-open standards chosen for use within the codebase MUST NOT hinder collaboration and reuse.
* If no existing open standard is available, effort SHOULD be put into developing one.
* Standards that are machine testable SHOULD be preferred over those that are not.

## Why this is important

* Creates interoperability between systems.
* Reduces possible vendor lock-in.
* Guarantees access to the knowledge required to reuse and contribute to the codebase.

## What this does not do

* Make it understandable how to use the software.

## How to test

* Confirm that data exchange follows an OSI approved open standard.
* Confirm that any non-open standards used are clearly documented as such.
* Confirm that documentation includes a list of the standards followed within the codebase, each with a working link, or a statement that no standards were chosen.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Mandate use of open standards everywhere possible.
* Prohibit procurement of technology that does not use open standards.

## Management: what you need to do

* Consider including open standard compliance assessment in [code](../glossary.md#code) reviews.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Add [continuous integration](../glossary.md#continuous-integration) tests for compliance with the standards.
* Review the commits and other [repository](../glossary.md#repository) resources for references to standards and cross-check those with the standards listed.

## Further reading

* [Open Standards principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles), [policy](../glossary.md#policy) paper of the UK Cabinet Office.
