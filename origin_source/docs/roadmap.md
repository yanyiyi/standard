This document intends to shed light on the current development plans of the team.
Plans change constantly as new information is absorbed by the team.

Codebase stewards review the roadmap monthly as part of our [backlog pruning session](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/standard-maintenance/backlog-pruning.html).

## Current work

* As far as possible, make the standard Standard-compliant
* Certification badges

## Near term

* Separate executive summary (issue #302)
* Physical paper checklist
* Possibly: add in the illustrations for each criterion

## Longer term

* Add to README and index.md information (and eventually statistics) on adoption and use (issue #438)
* Becoming validated by multiple codebases
* Release version 1.0.0 after a few codebases are compliant
* Linkable requirements
* New cover art
* Register for ISBN
* List with an on-demand book printing service
* QR codes for external links in print version
